# Pea Plant Breeding Simulator

## Overview

This JavaScript project is a simulator for breeding pea plants, demonstrating basic genetic inheritance in line with Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance.

The project creates virtual pea plants with five distinct traits: stem height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, and pod color. Each trait can take on two possible values, representing dominant and recessive alleles. The simulator allows you to breed plants together, producing offspring with combinations of traits based on Punnett square calculations. The outcome follows the principles of genetic inheritance.

## How to Use

Create Genesis Seed: The simulator starts by allowing you to create a "Genesis Seed". The Genesis Seed should be homozygous (both alleles are the same) for all traits.

Breeding: The simulator allows you to select two plants from the field and breed them together. The resulting offspring will be added to the field.

Visual Representation: Each plant is represented visually on the grid with its phenotype. You can select any plant on the grid to view its detailed genotype and phenotype information.

Genotype & Phenotype Stats: When you breed two plants together, the simulator also calculates and displays the statistics of genotype and phenotype combinations produced.

## Running the Simulator

To use this simulator, you'll need to serve the file in a web server environment as it interacts with the DOM. You can use any local server setup, or even host it on a web server. Once you open the page in a browser, you can interact with the simulator through the page.
